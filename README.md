In my experience with using JavaScript to build websites, I discovered its powerful interactivity and dynamic features. With the Fetch API, I could easily retrieve and update data, enhancing the user experience. Although the learning curve was steep, understanding asynchronous processing and the event loop made coding more efficient. The combination with HTML and CSS also made my site more visually appealing. This experience not only strengthened my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of web development as a whole.
